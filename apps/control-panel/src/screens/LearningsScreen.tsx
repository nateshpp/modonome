/**
 * Where the engine's judgment surfaces for a human to check. Open decisions ask an
 * explicit question before the engine proceeds; the learning queue shows the lessons
 * the engine has staged from repeated friction and the permanent gates those lessons
 * became once an owner promoted them. Nothing here becomes a binding rule without
 * that owner-gated step. Pruning a staged learning is a plain deletion, so it writes to
 * the real LEARNINGS.md when the panel is connected to live, writable state. Promoting
 * a learning or resolving a decision both require the operator to author real content
 * (a gate description, an actual answer) that this screen does not yet collect, so
 * those two stay local acknowledgments; do them by editing LEARNINGS.md or DECISIONS.md
 * directly, which is also what keeps those records honest instead of auto-filled.
