# The Governance Mesh Vision: Modonome as a WWW for Repositories

**Date:** 2026-06-25  
**Status:** Strategic Vision (Milestones 7-9+)

## The Idea

Modonome began as "autonomous governance for your repository." The next evolution is to
become infrastructure for **global, decentralized, autonomous governance**, a World Wide
Web for governance packets, where repositories worldwide can publish, discover, and learn
from each other's patterns, without a central authority.

Think of it as:
- **Git** (version control) + **GitHub** (social network of repos) = distributed code
- **Governance Mesh** = distributed governance knowledge

## The Architectural Layers

### Layer 1: Protocol (ADR-027)
**Governance Packet Protocol (GPP) v1**
- JSON-based, content-addressed (immutable via SHA256)
- Ed25519 signing for authenticity
- Packet types: gate, learning, pattern, role, integration
- Multiple maturity states: stable, advisory, experimental
- Transport-agnostic (HTTP, Git, IPFS, email, all valid)

**Benefit:** Any system can implement GPP; interoperability across governance frameworks.

### Layer 2: Discovery (ADR-028)
**Trust Network & Decentralized Discovery**
- Repos follow trusted repos (like social networks)
- Packets propagate via gossip (no central index required)
- Multiple discovery mechanisms (GitHub API, ActivityPub, DHT, RSS)
- Local search on cached packets; no central search engine

**Benefit:** Discovery is decentralized; no single entity controls what's visible.

### Layer 3: Evolution (ADR-029)
**Packet Lifecycle & Versioning**
- Packets evolve through states: published → advisory → stable → superseded → archived
- Content-addressed IDs never change; state evolves via amendments
- Explicit compatibility declarations
- Deprecation is public and traceable

**Benefit:** Packets can improve and retire gracefully without breaking content addresses.

### Layer 4: Trust & Feedback (ADR-030)
**Cross-Repo Governance Feedback**
- Repos publish validation signals when they adopt/reject packets
- Feedback propagates through trust networks
- Aggregated consensus emerges (no central authority needed)
- Negative feedback is valuable (helps others avoid bad packets)

**Benefit:** Trust is earned through use, not granted by a central authority.

### Layer 5: Safety (ADR-031 + ADR-032)
**Conflict Detection & Network-Level Ratchet**
- Packets declare incompatibilities (no silent conflicts)
- Import-time conflict detection
- Network-level ratchet watches for malicious patterns
- Multiple independent observers; no central gatekeeper

**Benefit:** Safety emerges from transparency, not from central control.

## Design Principles

1. **No Central Authority**
   - No single service that controls publication
   - No central index that decides visibility
   - Multiple discoverable and independent observers

2. **Local Validation Always**
   - Every repo runs its own ratchet on imported packets
   - Trust is verified locally, not delegated to the network
   - Network provides signal, repos make decisions

3. **Deterministic & Auditable**
   - Packets are signed, immutable, and inspectable
   - Every decision is traceable to evidence
   - No opaque algorithms; trust is explicit

4. **Opt-In & Reversible**
   - Repos choose what to follow and import
   - Repos can unimport packets at any time
   - No lock-in or irreversible adoption

5. **Decentralized Consensus**
   - Trust emerges from use, not from central ranking
   - Bad packets are isolated naturally (fewer repos follow bad actors)
   - Remediation is social, not technical

## How It Works: Example Flow

**Day 1: Google publishes a fix**
```
Google publishes packet (GPP v1, signed, on their repo)
├─ Content: "Checker gaming detection"
├─ Maturity: advisory
├─ Tags: #checker #gaming #safety
└─ Public key: github.com/google/keys/governance.pub
```

**Day 2: Kubernetes discovers and imports**
```
Kubernetes follows Google (trusts their governance)
├─ Sees the packet announcement (via GitHub API)
├─ Verifies signature (using Google's public key)
├─ Runs packet through its local ratchet (safety check)
├─ Adopts in advisory mode (observation window)
└─ Publishes: "Validating this packet" (to followers)
```

**Day 5: Startup discovers via Kubernetes**
```
Startup follows Kubernetes (trusts their judgment)
├─ Sees Kubernetes's validation signal
├─ Sees Google's original packet
├─ Sees positive validation from Kubernetes
├─ Decides to import (higher confidence)
├─ Adopts in advisory mode
└─ After 1 week: promotes to stable
```

**Day 10: Enterprise Bank decides against it**
```
Enterprise Bank follows both Google and Kubernetes
├─ Sees the packet
├─ Runs local ratchet (safety check)
├─ Rejects: "Doesn't fit our governance model"
├─ Publishes negative signal (to followers)
└─ Result: others see the rejection and understand trade-offs
```

**Result:** Global pattern discovered and validated organically, without a central authority.

## Comparison: Old vs. New

| Aspect | Pre-Mesh (Milestone 2) | Governance Mesh (M7-9) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Publishing** | Central catalog | Any repo can publish |
| **Discovery** | Query central catalog | Trust networks + multiple indexes |
| **Authority** | Catalog maintainer | Distributed consensus |
| **Feedback** | Hidden (not visible) | Public signals |
| **Conflict handling** | Undefined | Explicit detection + resolution |
| **Safety** | Central moderation | Local validation + network observation |
| **Lock-in** | High (central dependency) | Low (can switch observers) |

## Roadmap

- **Milestone 2** (current): Central opt-in catalog (foundation)
- **Milestone 7**: Governance Packet Protocol (GPP v1 standard)
- **Milestone 8**: Trust networks & decentralized discovery
- **Milestone 9**: Network-level safety (conflict detection, ratchet)
- **Milestone 10+**: Global governance mesh operational

## Why This Matters

1. **Network Effects**: Value increases as more repos participate
2. **Open Source Alignment**: Decentralized, collaborative, community-driven
3. **No Vendor Lock-In**: Repos aren't dependent on a central service
4. **Emergent Intelligence**: Patterns emerge from the network, not mandated
5. **Trust Through Transparency**: Trust is verifiable, not granted
6. **Sustainable**: No single entity needs to maintain a central service

## The Bet

**Old vision:** "Modonome helps *your* repo govern autonomously."

**New vision:** "Modonome enables *autonomous governance as a network property*, repos learn
from each other's mistakes and improvements, globally, without a central authority."

The second is more valuable, more aligned with open source, and scales indefinitely.

## How to Read the ADRs

Start here for the big picture, then dive into specifics:

1. **ADR-027: Governance Packet Protocol**: understand the format
2. **ADR-028: Trust Network & Discovery**: understand how packets spread
3. **ADR-029: Packet Lifecycle & Versioning**: understand how packets evolve
4. **ADR-030: Cross-Repo Governance Feedback**: understand trust propagation
5. **ADR-031: Semantic Compatibility & Conflicts**: understand safety
6. **ADR-032: Network-Level Ratchet**: understand network-level enforcement

Then relate them back to the existing architecture:
- **ADR-024 (Capability Promotion Gate)**: governs local adoption
- **ADR-025 (Self-Application Conformance)**: Modonome proves the model on itself
- **ADR-026 (Learning Promotion Audit Trail)**: makes rules traceable
