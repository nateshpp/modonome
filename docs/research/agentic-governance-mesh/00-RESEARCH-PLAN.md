# Agentic Governance Mesh: Research Direction

**Status:** Exploratory Research (not a committed roadmap)  
**Date:** 2026-06-25  
**Level of Commitment:** Investigation phase; proof-of-concept required before roadmap

---

## Problem Statement

**Current state:** Modonome enables autonomous governance *within a single repository*.
Each repo learns from its own corrections and improves its own gates.

**The gap:** Repos worldwide solve similar problems independently. When Google discovers
a checker-gaming attack, Kubernetes learns the same lesson weeks later. When a startup
finds a bug in governance, they reinvent the fix from scratch.

**The opportunity:** If governance knowledge could be shared and verified across repos,
teams could learn from each other's mistakes and improvements without centralized control.

This is not a business requirement for v0.2. It's a strategic direction for 2027+.

---

## Vision vs. Hypothesis

**Vision statement (aspirational):**
> A decentralized network where repositories share, discover, and validate governance
> patterns across organizational boundaries, enabling emergent governance practices without
> central authority.

**Hypothesis (testable):**
> If we define an open protocol for governance packets (ADR-027), we can demonstrate that
> repositories can safely import and validate knowledge from external sources, building
> confidence that a broader network is feasible.

## What This Is NOT

❌ A committed roadmap for 2026-2027  
❌ A replacement for Modonome's single-repo focus (M1-6)  
❌ A blockchain or centralized service  
❌ A quick implementation (realistic timeline: 2+ years)  
❌ A solution to an immediate business problem  

## What This IS

✓ An architectural exploration  
✓ A research direction for long-term value  
✓ A hypothesis to validate through experimentation  
✓ A strategic bet on decentralized governance at scale

## v0.1 Experiment (Proof of Concept)

**Goal:** Validate that an open governance packet protocol is viable.

**Scope:**
1. **Implement Governance Packet Protocol (GPP) v1 spec** (ADR-027)
   - JSON schema for packets
   - Content addressing (SHA256 hash)
   - Ed25519 signing
   - Published as an open standard (not Modonome-specific)

2. **Test on Modonome's own repo**
   - Publish 2-3 learnings from Modonome as GPP packets
   - Example: ADR-022 (checker gaming detection) as a packet
   - Sign with Modonome's governance key
   - Test import and validation on a sibling repo

3. **Measure success:**
   - Protocol is unambiguous; third-party tool can validate a packet
   - Packets are verifiable (signatures check out)
   - Packets are self-describing (readable without Modonome code)
   - No security regressions in import validation

**Timeline:** Q4 2026 (after Milestone 3)

**Go/No-Go Decision:** If v0.1 succeeds, explore ADR-028 (discovery). If it fails,
reassess whether a mesh is necessary.

## The Layered Architecture (For Reference)

If this direction proves sound, it would evolve through these layers:

| Layer | ADR | What It Does | Dependency |
|-------|-----|------|-----------|
| **Protocol** | 027 | Define packet format, signing, versioning | Proof of concept |
| **Discovery** | 028 | Trust networks, decentralized indexing | M2 central catalog stable |
| **Evolution** | 029 | Lifecycle states, amendments, compatibility | Discovery working |
| **Feedback** | 030 | Cross-repo validation signals | Evolution stable |
| **Safety** | 031-032 | Conflict detection, network ratchet | Feedback flowing |

Each layer is a self-contained research phase. No layer is committed until the prior one
is proven.

## Why Not Use a Central Catalog?

**Central catalog (Milestone 2) trade-offs:**
- ✓ Simpler to implement and maintain
- ✓ Easier to search and discover
- ✗ Creates a bottleneck
- ✗ Single point of control/failure
- ✗ Requires a service operator

**Decentralized mesh (this research) trade-offs:**
- ✓ No bottleneck or central control
- ✓ Aligns with open source culture
- ✓ Enables network effects
- ✗ Harder to discover (for users)
- ✗ Higher coordination complexity
- ✗ Longer timeline

**Decision:** Start with M2 (simpler, proven). Research M7+ (ambitious, unproven).

---

## Risks & Failure Modes

**What could go wrong:**

1. **Protocol complexity:** If GPP is too complex, adoption stalls
   - Mitigation: Keep v1 minimal; add features only after use

2. **Discovery is hard:** Without central ranking, users can't find packets
   - Mitigation: Start with trust networks; add search later if needed

3. **Network fragmentation:** Different clusters of trust form
   - Mitigation: Acceptable outcome; federation is expected

4. **Malicious packets:** Bad actors publish harmful governance patterns
   - Mitigation: Local validation always; network ratchet warns

5. **Coordination overhead:** Too many decisions to make
   - Mitigation: v0.1 focuses on protocol only; discovery decisions later

**Conditions to abandon this direction:**
- v0.1 protocol proves unworkable
- Modonome can't demonstrate it on its own repo
- User feedback indicates central catalog is preferred
- Implementation timeline balloons beyond 2+ years
- A better standard emerges (e.g., from CNCF)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Q3 2026):** Document this research plan; gather feedback from
   early users and the community

2. **Q4 2026:** Implement ADR-027 (GPP protocol spec) as a standalone open standard

3. **Q1 2027:** Test import/export on Modonome's own repo (proof of concept)

4. **Q2 2027:** Review v0.1 results; decide whether to pursue M7 (discovery)

5. **2027+:** If v0.1 succeeds, explore the full mesh (layered approach)

## How This Fits Into Modonome's Strategy

**Committed roadmap (Milestones 1-6):**
- M1: Core loop (stable ✓)
- M2: Knowledge network (Q4 2026, central catalog)
- M3: Control panel (2027)
- M4: Enterprise adapters (2027)
- M5: Market researcher (2027)
- M6: Self-governance hardening (committed this month)

**Research direction (Milestones 7+):**
- Explore agentic governance mesh as long-term strategic direction
- Validate through v0.1 experiment (GPP protocol)
- Decide in Q2 2027 whether to commit to full mesh

**Decoupled:** Research doesn't block the roadmap. M1-6 ship on schedule. Research
happens in parallel and informs future direction.
