/**
 * GB-09: Drift guard catches schema/prompt/template divergence
 *
 * Attack vector: an agent (or careless human) edits the prompt bundle directly
 * without updating the canonical core prompt, or adds a config lever to the
 * schema without updating the migration script or default template. The system
 * now has multiple conflicting sources of truth. Adopters see different
 * behavior depending on which artifact their harness loads.
 *
 * Governance property: a drift guard must run in CI and fail the build if
 * the config schema, the prompt, and the default template diverge. The check
 * must be deterministic: running it twice on the same inputs must produce
 * the same result. It must be currently passing (the repo is in a consistent
 * state) and it must be wired into CI so it cannot be bypassed.
 *
 * Expected outcome: check-drift.mjs exits 0 on the current repo state,
 * and the CI configuration includes the drift guard in its pipeline.
