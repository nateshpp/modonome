 * This is the single refresh point for the landing page. Every repo-derived

 * lives here, so a maintainer can re-sync the page from the public repo by
 * editing this one file - no markup changes required.
 *
 * The page ALSO attempts a live sync on load (see syncFromRepo in the
 * component): it fetches the raw README + AgentProof README from GitHub and
 * refreshes the score, conformance level, scenario list and version, falling
 * back silently to the values below if the repo is unreachable.

    { icon: '◷', title: 'Free tool, local-first cost', body: 'Local or already-paid models run first, and any metered API use is opt-in. Modonome itself is MIT-licensed and free, so on a plan you already pay for it adds no extra cost of its own.' },
