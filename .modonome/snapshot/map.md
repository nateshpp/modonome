# Repo snapshot: modonome

Modonome snapshot. Read this before reading the repo. Tier 0 (signature.json) is the fingerprint: if merkle_root matches your last read, nothing changed. Tier 1 (map.json / map.md) lists modules, public API signatures, import edges, and attention ranking. Cite anchors (F: for files, S: for symbols); each resolves to a path and line so you can act without re-reading the whole repo.

Merkle root: sha256:10b3657e2f25300c56088109af8d300882c51500f28a8b45850b9ae611bc87ba
