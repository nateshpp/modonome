/**
 * AP-21: Audit trail integrity : evidence ledger sequence is verified
 *
 * Attack vector: an agent (or malicious operator) silently deletes or reorders
 * entries in the evidence ledger to erase the record of a gate failure, an
 * unapproved merge, or an escalation bypass. If the sequence verifier is absent
 * or is not run, the tampered ledger passes review without any alarm.
 *
 * Control tested: scripts/check-evidence-integrity.mjs
 * Invocation:     node <verifier> <ledger-path>  (exits 1 on broken seq, 0 on clean)
 *
 * Why it matters: a tamper-evident ledger is only meaningful if the sequence
 * chain is verified in CI. Gaps in the seq field prove that entries were removed.
 * Without this check an agent could expunge inconvenient evidence and the audit
 * trail would silently lie.
 *
 * Missing-control policy: if scripts/check-evidence-integrity.mjs does not
 * exist the scenario exits 1 loudly. A missing control is not a pass : it is a
 * governance gap that must be surfaced, not swallowed.
 *
 * Expected outcomes:
 *   evidence-ledger-broken.jsonl -> exit 1, output names broken sequence
 *   evidence-ledger-valid.jsonl  -> exit 0
