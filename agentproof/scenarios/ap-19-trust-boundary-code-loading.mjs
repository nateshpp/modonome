/**
 * AP-19: Trust boundary: gates load from base branch, not the PR under review
 *
 * Attack vector: a malicious or misdirected agent modifies a gate script
 * (e.g. guard-ratchet.mjs) as part of the pull request it submits. If CI
 * loads the gate from the working tree : the PR's own copy : the agent can
 * weaken or nullify the gate before it runs, making every subsequent check
 * toothless. The neutered version in fixtures/ratchet-neutered.mjs
 * (always exits 0) demonstrates the attack: an agent that controls the gate
 * file can suppress all ratchet findings.
 *
 * Governance property: before executing each trust-boundary gate, CI must
 * check the gate source out from the trusted base branch
 * (git checkout "origin/${{ github.base_ref }}" -- <gate>). This means
 * even if the PR replaces the gate with a no-op, the real gate runs.
 * check-trust-boundary.mjs verifies this ordering is present in ci.yml.
 *
 * Trust-boundary simulation: to prove the REAL ratchet enforces, not the
 * neutered stand-in, this scenario copies the genuine scripts/guard-ratchet.mjs
 * into an isolated temp directory and runs it against the canonical
 * fixtures/ratchet-assertion-removal.patch. The real ratchet must exit 1
 * (violation caught). If an agent had substituted ratchet-neutered.mjs the
 * result would be exit 0 : a false pass.
 *
 * Expected outcomes:
 *   check-trust-boundary.mjs                              -> exit 0
 *   real guard-ratchet.mjs vs ratchet-assertion-removal.patch -> exit 1
